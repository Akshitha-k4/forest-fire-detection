Importance of Early Detection: Early identification of forest fires is vital to minimize damage and ensure rapid response.
Causes: Fires can start from natural events like lightning or human activities such as unattended campfires.
Modern Technologies: Satellite imagery, drones with thermal cameras, and AI are key tools for detecting and monitoring fires.
Traditional Methods: Fire lookout towers and ground patrols have been used for decades to identify fires.
Challenges: Remote locations, dense forests, and false alarms can complicate detection efforts.
Global Impact: Forest fires contribute to climate change and biodiversity loss, making early identification essential.
Objective:
To identify forest fires from the image data set 
Try to identify fire from smoke and light and other indications also.
To build a models that automatically detects the presence of fire/smoke in images
